#### STRXNGERS website by Gage Lieble
> A website made for a freinds clothing brand
## Project Outline
STRXNGERS is a punk street wear brand that drops various clothing items such as hats, tees, hoodies, sweaters, pants, and so on. This website was created as the online store front for this brand. Users are able to view the product information, and make purchases through the website. I've made two seperate html files that the website takes advantage of and these pages include the product page and the users cart. Users have the ability to add/remove from their cart with live cart price updates.
